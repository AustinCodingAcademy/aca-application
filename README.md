# Application Project

## Welcome
Welcome to the Austin Coding Academy Application Project! Here is where you can show off your favorite technologies, your obsession with coding styles and best practices, and get a chance to teach us something about you.

## Setup Instructions
1. Fork this repository
2. Get busy

## How This Works
This repository's default branch is `gh-pages`. When you fork it, it will auto host itself at _username_.github.io/aca-application. The landing page should contain information about yourself. Feel free to style it to your liking. Your projects will live in the repo as `.html` files, and you can link to your assets from within the repo.

## Class Levels
We currently have three levels of a web development track: Intro, Intermediate, Advanced. Depending on your comfort level, you can choose to build a project relating to any or all of the three levels.

## Project Specs
**If you choose to submit an Intro project, we will be looking for:**

1. Modern web design components. You can get some ideas from [here](http://noeticforce.com/modern-web-design-elements-apps-and-websites)
1. Ability to design for mobile, tablet, and desktop using a responsive grid
2. Knowledge of a popular CSS framework such as Bootstrap and Foundation, as well as Material Design principles are a plus. You don't have to use them for this project, but your CSS should be organized in a modular framework-like way.
3. The project can be about any subject, one or more pages, and can contain generated "Lorem Ipsum" text, stock photos, etc.
4. You can use CDNs for any libraries, and put this file in this repository and link to it from the landing page.

**If you are going for Intermediate:**

1. Build a game, such as [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)), using JavaScript and jQuery. 
2. Using the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and AJAX, insert the javascript code below the game. Bonus points for syntax highlighting
3. Since this is all frontend, you should be able to host it from this repository. Link to it from the landing page.


**So you want to turn it up to 11? For the Advanced course:**

1. Build a fullstack webapp, such as a trello clone, with a RESTful, MVC architectured backend API using whatever you are familiar with, bonus points if you use Node.js/Express.js.
2. Use a database
2. On the frontend, construct a single page app using your preferred framework, bonus points for using Backbone.js.
3. Authentication is not necessary
3. Would be awesome if you could host it on Heroku, AWS, etc, but if you can't figure it out just link to the source with instructions to get it going.
